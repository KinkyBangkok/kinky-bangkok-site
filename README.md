## Development

To run locally, make sure you have `pnpm` (a better `npm`) installed. It is installable with `npm i -g pnpm` or through [the instrutions](https://pnpm.io/installation).

```sh
# Create your local .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Start the dev server
npm start
```

## Production

This runs on Netlify. CI is already setup. For it to update, just commit to `main`.
