# Deviant Thailand

## Self-Introduction

We organize curated events with hand-picked participants:

- Lifestyle parties
- BDSM events
- Roleplays
- Orgies
- Gangbangs
- Educational events
- Fantasy fulfillment
- Professional Dom-Dominatrix services

Our events range from very vanilla to very extreme-hardcore. Our client list consists mostly of classy, youngish, fit, sexy, playful, kinky and respectful expats living or travelling in the region.

Keep an eye for our upcoming events and if you are interested in one of them please contact us here or in LINE ID: Dim1980 or in SDC: DeviantThailand for more information.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We will reply to all messages from couples and singles that are verified, have some pictures and a solid description. Despite that the screening process to enter one of our events is rigorous and only those meeting our high standards will be vetted- invited in one of our events!

## How to get vetted

In order to enter in one of our advertised events you need to be vetted. This is mostly to ensure the safety and satisfaction of our existing members.

The vetting process is quite straightforward, albeit rigorous and definitely takes some time since it includes 3 steps. Besides the common sense rules that unfortunately are not so common sense in our lifestyles nowadays; like be respectful, hygienic, non judgmental and so on there are some other specific requirements which we have to also post here, some we also post in our events advertisements.

Step #1:

- Text us ONLY in DM in any of our platforms (include where you saw our profile though and your profile name). Introduce yourself in an intelligent way and proove to us that you fit in one of our curated events
- Text us ONLY If you have verified profile
- Text us ONLY If you have some description and pictures of you
- Text us ONLY If you are HWP, respectful and able to follow simple rules.
- If the above are not followed dont expect a possitive reply from us.

Step #2:
Is a quick questionnaire that we will send you online after you pass step #1!

step #3:
Is a meeting in real life but in vanilla environment to see if our energies match and you are who you say you are! This will happen ONLY if someone passes the first 2 steps!

We do understand that for some that the above is quite some work. If you are not willing to put the work for one reason or another please don't contact us. If you are lazy or skeptical to do these 3 steps probably you will be lazy in our events too and we are seeking assertive people

As mentioned we are doing our best to keep the quality of people invited to our events as high as possible and this vetting method is the best way to do that.

Having said that; getting vetted and accepted in one event doesn't make you a member though. This includes a total different process TBA!
