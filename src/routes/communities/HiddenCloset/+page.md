# The Hidden Closet

## About

The only remarkable thing about the quiet alley of Soi Thonglor 6 is barber shop Black Amber (and its namesake bar opposite) where the city’s hipsters come for preppy dos and to get their beards styled. But the discreet-looking barber shop actually houses Bangkok’s first standalone sex shop, where all things kinky and erotic are up for grabs.

Climb up the stairs to the second floor to access an emporium that reveals a fetish for  risqué fashion and naughty things. An overspill of dazzlingly upmarket lingerie, latex rubber suits and sexy cosplay outfits make up most of the display, along with a selection of masks and hoods for “fun” role-playing.

BDSM enthusiasts can also stock up for their playrooms with an array of equipment and restraints from celebrated adult-toy brands like Bettie Page and Fifty Shades of Grey (the line actually produces all the lust-fueling items featured in the movie), including  bondage rope, “love rings,” and furry butt plugs. You can ask to view more items other than what are on display. Have fun!
