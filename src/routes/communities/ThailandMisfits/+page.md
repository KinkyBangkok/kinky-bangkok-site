# Thailand Misfits

## Self-Introduction

A group of real life people who are active in the BDSM Alternative Lifestyle, mostly from Bangkok but also from other areas both in and outside of Thailand.
We are here to learn, play and grow our community together. All roles, and D/s styles, asexual, bi, gay, pansexual, straight, queer, cis, non-binary, genderfluid, trans, singles, couples, poly, curious, uncertain or any other way you choose to identify yourself - everyone is welcome!

## Rules

- UNDERAGED Members are NOT ALLOWED. No child porn (gifs, images, videos, links, etc.)
- No discussion / imagery of sex with minors or REAL animals (pet and furry play discussions are welcome).
- No religious or political discussion (especially the Thai Royal Family and Thai politics).
- No uploading pictures of other members without permission.
- All opinions are welcome – RESPECT EACH OTHER! Debate is fine, but no arguments. State your feelings and move on if there is a disagreement.
- No bigotry, misandry or misogyny – unless its consensual fetish play or discussion.
- No fetish name use, such as slut, whore, sub, pet, etc. unless consented.
- Respect D/s relationships, if you privately text another member, you should start by asking what relationship status they hold so as to not make them or - partners feel disrespected.
- NO SHAMING – everyone has a fetish or a preference others might find disturbing or distasteful. This is a shaming free group. You don’t like the topic, don’t - join the discussion. Someone might feel the same way about your personal fetishes or preferences and gave you the same respect.
- Don’t be shy, ask any questions you may have.
