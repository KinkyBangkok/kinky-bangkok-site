# KinkyBKK by Pulse Clinic

## Self-Introduction

KinkyBKK Xtend is an event initiated by PULSE Clinic and PULSE Gallery to raise awareness on sexual well-being for global community in Bangkok.

## Why Kinky BKK

While acceptance of BDSM and fetishes has increased over the past few decades, we still have a long way to go.

Acceptance to our sexuality (by ourselves, community and the society) has higher impact on person well-being as a whole.

Government of many countries declared consensual kinky sex acts like face-sitting, flogging and watersports to be illegal, while ignoring a wide range of less kinky but equally extreme activities. People who engage in BDSM still run the risk of losing their jobs or having their fitness as parents investigated if they are ‘outed’.

That's why we are here to raise awareness on consentual activities to create safe space to keep our community happy - healthy and h*rny.

Have fun liberating your kinky self – and being part of the sex positive movement as you do it!
