# Subbie Group

## Self-Introduction

This is a profile for the Bangkok s-types group. If you're a submissive/slave or any other s-type, then message us to join us at one of our munches or our discussion group. Friends of the account will be those vetted into the groups or who have attended groups*.

If you're not an s-type who's in/a regular visitor to BKK (or one of our SE Asia friends), you're welcome to follow the account.

The account is managed by @MyArms_BendBack with the support of the Bangkok submissives.

*This is not a recommendation of people being safe to play with, just their relationship with the account :) We always recommend both sides of the slash do great communications and negotiation before play.
